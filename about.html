          <p>As an amateur photographer, I continue learning and my work continues improving. New subjects and 
            challenges are the chemistry developing my work. I have long enjoyed the meditative quality of 
            observing the natural world. That said, I am also drawn to photograph the built world through an 
            admiring eye. And more recently I have set myself the challenge of learning more about working with 
            light by photographing both still lifes and portraits in the studio.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To the casual observer, my exploration and selection of such a wide array of subjects might seem 
            indiscriminate, although I prefer to call it eclectic. People familiar with my compositional style often 
            describe it as minimalist, but I know it is not. Perhaps what they are referring to is my use of 
            negative space, which I think allows the subject room to breathe. Also, I favor emotion over technique. 
            If given a choice between a technically perfect photograph with no soul and a slightly out-of-focus 
            image conveying emotion, I'd choose emotion every time.</p>
          <br>
          <p>That said, I do keep developing my technical skills. As a child, my fondness for photography started 
            with the analog: a Polaroid with self-developing film and a Kodak Instamatic with those cube-shaped 
            flashbulbs. In college, one of the requirements for my Bachelor of Science in journalism degree was to 
            take a photojournalism class, where I learned to use a 35mm film camera and to develop my own 
            black-and-white images. Today I use a Nikon D5000, I shoot in color as well as monochrome, and I and am 
            fascinated by the technology of Photoshop.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am a member of the KC Society for Contemporary Photography and Midwest TFP â€“ A Creative Collaboration 
            Community.</p>
          <br>
          <p>A fun fact about me: I once had a Top Secret Security clearance.</p>
          <br> 
          <p>One of my favorite quotes: <i>To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the 
            same field, it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen 
            again.</i>&#8202;<span>--</span>&#8202;Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
